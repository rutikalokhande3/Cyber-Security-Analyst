# Cyber-Security-Analyst
As a Cyber Security Analyst at TechCorp (via Tata Forage Virtual Program), I engaged in real-world simulations including phishing detection, threat analysis, SIEM log interpretation, and incident reporting. The program helped build hands-on skills in securing digital systems and understanding cybersecurity workflows within a corporate environment.
